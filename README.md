<h1>Portfolio</h1>
This is my personal portfolio that lets you know a little about me.<br>
You can see a few of my projects that I have learned from coding bootcamp courses. I am updating this with links to new projects. Please take a look at my Github page for more projects and my Linkedin profile for more professional achievements.
